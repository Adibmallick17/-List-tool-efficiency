The state of your implementation - Assignment is completed 

A short summary of what you have learned about the relative amounts of time required to perform these tasks:

In this assignment, I have gain valuable insights into the efficiency of different data structures and their impact on program performance, particularly when dealing with substantial datasets. The assignment's primary takeaway is the significance of data structure choice in software development. It showcases how the selection of data structures, such as arrays or linked lists, can greatly influence program efficiency and resource utilization. Furthermore, the assignment provides an opportunity to learn about memory management in C, emphasizing the proper allocation and deallocation of memory to prevent memory leaks and resource wastage. Additionally, I have delve into performance metrics and timing tools, including the use of the clock() function. By measuring and comparing the runtime of various programs, I have gain practical experience in assessing their efficiency.
